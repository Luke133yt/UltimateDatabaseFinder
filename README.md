# UltimateDatabaseFinder
A Finder Tool that i've made in my freetime to find string in some suspiscious Database


I've basically develop this app just for check if someone is in the "Facebook Telephone Number Leaked Database"

I know that there's some bug in this code, but i don't have enough time to fix the error in this moment.

If you want you can use my project to make other similar app that can check database divided by line

Requirements:
Colorama (i use this library just because i don't want to develop the app for different OS, if you want you can remove the import and the Fore.<color> and just use the terminal color)

Run:

Windows:
py main.py

Linux:
python3 main.py

Then is gonna ask what do you want to do with the app, use the number to select in the menu and then insert a tag that is gonna use to find out

If you want to use with FTNLDB, remeber that the file is organized like this:
File:
<name of the country>.txt

Content:
ID1:phone_number:name:surname:male:birth_place:live_place:relationship:job:join_date join_hour PM/AM:mail:birth_date


Remember kids this is only a tool to find if YOUR and only YOUR mobile phone is in the DB, and not others mobile phone is leaked in the DB.

Use wisely.
